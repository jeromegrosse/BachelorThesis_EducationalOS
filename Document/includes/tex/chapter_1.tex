\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

Nowadays, we are surrounded by computers: Smart phones, laptops, desktops, cars, gaming consoles, tablets, calculators, clusters, embedded systems. These are all classes of devices that render the broad term of \textit{computer} poor of sense. For each of them, there are specific needs that has to be fulfilled to make them useful. Part of these needs are reflected through the processor architecture.

During this lasts years, ARM (Advanced RISC Machines) has gained popularity as it is the CPU architecture of choice of every hand-held devices, the most sold devices\cite{gartner_mobile_grow}. It allows a low power consumption compared to other architecture like i386 with a great trade-off in computational power.


\section{The Raspberry Pi}

From Wikipedia\cite{wikipedia_raspberry_pi}

\begin{displayquote}
The Raspberry Pi is a series of credit card-sized single-board computers developed in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools.
\end{displayquote}

The Raspberry Pi has been designed by scientists from the University of Cambridge with their first commercial model released in 2012. The Raspberry Pi has been designed with a powerful optic in mind: The bring a fully-fledged cheap computer.

The Raspberry Pi used for the bachelor thesis is the model B+ that includes on-the-go a GPU, a sounds card, an ARM11 CPU and a SD Card reader. Bellow is a table that sums up the specifications of said model:

\end{table}

The device is incredibly small and cheap for its capabilities, which makes it a device of choices for investigations and small projects. The Linux kernel (and therefore several distributions such as Debian or ArchLinux) has been ported to the Raspberry Pi. Several libraries have been implemented to control the hardware easily from the user space. Remarkable projects have already been made such as media centres\cite{osmc}, emulation distribution\cite{retropie}.


\section{Research context}
The context of this paper is the Bachelor Thesis (Trabajo de fin de Grado) in the University Carlos III de Madrid.


\section{Main objectives}

The goal of this research is to build from the ground up an educational kernel for the Raspberry Pi. The objective is not to propose a professionally made and usable OS but instead, propose an implementation with a clear code and explanation of an operating system usable on the Raspberry Pi. To do so, one of the main objective is to research the low level functioning of the hardware, that is, how things work and communicate on a bare-metal level as well as building a system on the studied hardware. The main guideline can be presented as following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Analysis and understanding of the basics of the ARM architecture}: The ARM architecture is complex and presents tools and features for a wide range of use cases. We will mainly focus on the booting process as well as understanding how the different part of the Raspberry works (GPIO, Timers, GPU amongst other).
\item \textbf{Building a kernel able to boot and execute a program}: The main goal of a kernel is to interact with the hardware of the device and getting things ready to execute some arbitrary code.
\item \textbf{Hardware Drivers:} That is mostly to be able to use the other hardware besides the processor that the Raspberry Pi uses. A device is useless if it cannot interact with the outside world, the kernel should handle the output of data (using a screen and/or a serial cable) as well as being able to receive data from outside (keystrokes).
\item \textbf{Memory management}: Allocating data given a size at run-time and returning an address to the process, this is pretty much implementing the UNIX's C function \textit{malloc}.
\item \textbf{Threads management}: Creation of the context of thread and more generally of a process. This include being able to start, pause and terminate process as well as having independent stacks.
\item \textbf{Threads scheduling}: Implementation of scheduling algorithms for the threads in order to achieve multitasking.
\item \textbf{Interaction with the user:} In order not to have a black box devoid of life, the OS should be able to output data (show debug messages, display pictures on the screen or flash an LED) and handle inputs from the users (basic commands).
\item \textbf{Multitasking}: The main goal of an OS is to allow multi-tasking, that is, offer the illusion that several taskw are executing at the same time while in fact each task is allocated a short amount of time before stopping its execution, executing the following task, etc.
\end{itemize}
